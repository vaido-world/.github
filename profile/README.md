## Welcome to Vaido World

These are my open personal notes.

Useless software:  
Visual Studio Code | Won't use it again. Frontend is browser-like. Written in JavaScript using Electron framework.
  
Finding a job in Europe using Eures portal:  
* Use search keywords `computer software developer scientist`  
* Tick the `English`  
* Tick the `Work schedule: Full-time`  
* Preferebly tick the `EURES flag: With EURES flag`
