The best way to earn some monies is by contracting companies.  
Where they take care of traveling and housing.  

None of the countries have English language as primary.   
Some even do not have € Euro as the country's currency.

[Accurate representation of the Norden countries.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_SaRMP90OA)

Uhh, so it might be only Sweden or Finland for me.  
It's important even if I won't migrate there immediately.  

Having a work experience and connections   
in the country does help with the overall access.  

Sweden looks more cute, but Finland has Euro currency.  
This shows a lot about their caring and their standards.  

I'm starting to like Finland more, they seem to be more open.  
They actually post job applications on EURES portal. (With EURES FLAG)
